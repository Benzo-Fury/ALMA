• Ability to learn from new data  
• Generates responses in real-time

## Planned Features/Todo

• Refractor/Overhall the whole memory system  
• ~~Welcome messages generated by your faverate chatbot/personality~~  
• Rewrite every message and embeds that users see and add emojis  

## Contributing

## Other

The aesthetic presentation of messages and embeds is not a current priority and is scheduled to be addressed at a later time for enhancement purposes.
